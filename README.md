- 👋 Hi, I’m Sanna Tikkakoski!
- 👀 I’m an ICT Engineering (B.Eng) student who's in her 2nd year at Oulu University of Applied Sciences in Oulu, Finland.
- 🗝️ Key things in school so far have been Object-Oriented Programming, project work (including documentation!), version control, Java, C/C++, web apps, cloud services, relational databases, and RESTful APIs.
- 🤖 Coming up later this academic year: a larger web app project, mobile development theory, and a larger mobile app project.
- 🏦 My favorite project in school so far has been making an ATM simulator app (Node.js backend, Qt frontend)!
- 💞️ I'm especially interested in all things UX, because that's what initially sparked my passion for the IT field.
- 📫 Reach me at sanna-poritikkakoski on LinkedIn!
