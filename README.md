- 👋 Hi, I’m Sanna Pöri-Tikkakoski!
- 👀 I’m an ICT Engineering (BEng) student at Oulu University of Applied Sciences in Oulu, Finland.
- 🌱 So far in school I’ve been learning C/C++, QT programming, OOP in general, relational databases (MySQL) and REST API, and a bit of back-end Javascript.
- 🏦 Currently working on a larger project where I'll be programming a mock ATM app!
- 🤖 Also learning some Python in my spare time.
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to learning new things about programming and getting my career started! 
- 📫 Reach me at sanna-poritikkakoski on LinkedIn!
