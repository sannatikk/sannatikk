- 👋 Hi, I’m Sanna Tikkakoski!
- 👀 I’m an ICT Engineering (Software Development major) student who's just wrapping up her 2nd year at Oulu University of Applied Sciences in Oulu, Finland.
- 🏢 Present in each semester has been a deep focus on realistic project work, including documentation and version control!
- 🗝️ Some key things in school so far have been web development, mobile development, agile work methods and project management, relational databases and REST APIs, cloud services, and applied math and physics, as well as languages, frameworks, and toolkits like JavaScript, C++, Java, C, Kotlin, React, React Native, Expo, and Jetpack Compose.
- 🤖 Coming up later this academic year: a larger mobile app project.
- 🎬 My favorite project in school so far has been making a web app for movie enthusiasts using React, Node, and PostgreSQL!
- 💞️ I'm currently especially interested in backend development, data, testing, and signal processing.
- 🫣 My secret dream is to one day work as a project manager or product owner! Give me a planner, a backlog, and some customer relations, and I'm a very happy camper.
