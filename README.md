- 👋 Hi, I’m Sanna Tikkakoski!
- 👀 I’m an ICT Engineering (Software Development major) student who's in her 2nd year at Oulu University of Applied Sciences in Oulu, Finland.
- 🗝️ Some key things in school so far have been Object-Oriented Programming, relational databases and RESTful APIs, Java, C/C++, React, and cloud services.
- 🏢 Present in each semester has been a deep focus on realistic project work, including documentation and version control!
- 🤖 Coming up later this academic year: wrapping up a larger web app project, some mobile development theory, and a larger mobile app project.
- 🏦 My favorite project in school so far has been making a web app for movie enthusiasts using React+Node!
- 💞️ I'm especially interested in UX, because that's what initially sparked my passion for the IT field, and testing, because I'm a little neurotic.
- 🫣 My secret dream is to work as a project manager or product owner! Give me a calendar, project plans, and a backlog, and I'm a very happy camper.
- 📫 Reach me at sanna-poritikkakoski on LinkedIn!
