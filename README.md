- 👋 Hi, I’m Sanna Pöri-Tikkakoski!
- 👀 I’m an ICT Engineering (BEng) student who just wrapped up her first year at Oulu University of Applied Sciences in Oulu, Finland.
- 🌱 Keywords in school during my first year were C/C++, Qt programming, OOP in general, relational databases (MySQL) and REST API.
- 🏦 My favorite project in school so far has been making an ATM simulator app (Node.js backend, Qt frontend)!
- 🤖 Also learning some Python in my spare time.
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to learning new things about programming and getting my career started! 
- 📫 Reach me at sanna-poritikkakoski on LinkedIn!
