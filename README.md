- 👋 Hi, I’m Sanna Tikkakoski!
- 👀 I’m an ICT Engineering (Software Development major) student who's just wrapping up her 2nd year at Oulu University of Applied Sciences in Oulu, Finland.
- 🏢 Present in each semester has been a deep focus on realistic project work, including documentation and version control!
- 🗝️ Key things in school so far: web development, mobile development, agile work methods and project management, relational databases and REST APIs, cloud services, and applied math & physics.
- 🛠️ Familiar with languages, frameworks, and toolkits like JavaScript, Node, React, React Native, Expo, Python, Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, C++, QT, Java, C.
- 🌱 Coming up this spring: a larger mobile app project for managing houseplant care!
- 💞️ I'm currently especially interested in backend development and testing-related tasks.
- 🫣 My secret dream is to one day combine my technical skills with my knack for handling the big picture and work as a project manager!
